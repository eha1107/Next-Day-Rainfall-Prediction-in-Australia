# Next-Day-Rainfall-Prediction-in-Australia
Presenting a machine learning project inclusive of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a predictive model designed to forecast next-day rainfall. The project involves training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

# Problem Statement
The Rain in Australia dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.Create a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow.

## Objective
Predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow by training a binary classification model on target RainTomorrow.
