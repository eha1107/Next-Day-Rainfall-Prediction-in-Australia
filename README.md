# Next-Day-Rainfall-Prediction-in-Australia
Presenting a machine learning project inclusive of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a predictive model designed to forecast next-day rainfall. The project involves training classification models on the target variable RainTomorrow.

## Problem Statement
The [Rain in Australia dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.Create a fully-automated system that can use today's weather data for a given location to predict whether it will rain at the location tomorrow.

## Project Summary
Next day Rainfall Prediction in Australia project involved extensive data analysis , feature engineering, and model selection to accurately forecast ranifall for next day. Here is a brief overview of the project steps and key findings:

**1.**  Downloaded Rain in Australia dataset from kaggle using opendatasets library within jupyter.

**2.** Spearheaded an end-to-end machine learning project focusing on next-day rainfall prediction. Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**3.** Demonstrated proficiency in training and interpreting classification models, particularly decision trees and random forests. Employed advanced techniques to address overfitting and executed hyperparameter tuning, ensuring optimal model performance.

**4.** Led the preparation of a comprehensive dataset for model training, emphasizing meticulous data cleaning and feature engineering. Leveraged industry best practices to enhance the quality of inputs, resulting in improved model accuracy.

**5.** Applied predictive analytics to make accurate rainfall predictions for the next day. Successfully implemented the trained models to make single-input predictions, showcasing the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
